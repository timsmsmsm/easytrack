# Summary



# Statement of need

Cell tracking is the task of following individual cells over time and space, essential for understanding dynamic processes 
in cell biology. For instance, cell tracking can reveal how tissues heal themselves [@Tetley:2019], or how tissues grow 
and develop [@Valon:2021]. Despite significant advances in computational tools for automated cell tracking in time-lapse
microscopy images [@Btrack:2017], current tracking software often requires time-consuming manual parameter tuning to 
achieve accurate results.
